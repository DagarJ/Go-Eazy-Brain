The intent of our idea is to benefit the EdTech industry  especially the rural children with the aid of available modern technologies. We will build a web app where users can register themselves and perform activities as following:
1. enroll for the available courses & track progress (use of SQL server DB for courses data)
2. predict their career fields at the end of courses considering their performance so far,if they are not satisfied with the result they can go for recommended courses      to improve their score for a particular career field(use of ML for prediction)
3. self evaluation can be taken by students themselves to test their knowledge(no need to depend on teacher's quiz or test) (use of ML for generating quizes)
4. feedback on the courses and use of sentiment analysis in order to track the trending courses (use of ML for sentiment analysis)
5. creating social awareness on the garbage classification where they can learn reuse,recycle and reduce concepts by simply uploading garbage type image and learning      on the go (use of ML for image classification)
6. diagnose their diet in order to stay healthy and active (use of ML for classification) and suggestion thereafter
7. courses on modern farmimg techniques as well so that rural children are aware of the possibilities and its impact and take advantage accordingly
